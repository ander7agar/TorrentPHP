 * Class ClientAdapter
 *
 * This class decorates (wraps) the ClientTransport object. It is used to turn any json into valid Torrent objects.
 *
 * Methods defined in here can override those in ClientTransport and modify the output (for example - into Torrents).
 * Methods not defined in here are forwarded to the ClientTransport, if they exist.
 *
 * To write your own client adapter, create a class that extends this class, and implement your own client-specific
 * decoration methods that override your client transport methods.
